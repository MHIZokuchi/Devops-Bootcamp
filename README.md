## 💡 Tips for Success

### As a Learner

1. **Type every command** - Copy-pasting defeats the purpose
2. **Read the error messages** - They tell you what went wrong
3. **Ask questions** - Join the community WhatsApp/Slack
4. **Practice regularly** - 15 minutes daily beats 3 hours once a week
5. **Share what you learn** - Teaching others solidifies your knowledge

### For Maximum Retention

- Do the practice exercises after each section
- Redo the exercises a week later
- Try to remember commands without looking them up
- Explain concepts to someone else
- Build a personal project combining what you learned
